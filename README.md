You may also need the [Awesome font](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome) for i3blocks to show certain icons properly.

### i3blocks

## Folder Linking

Because I'm too lazy to do something with `ln`, I'll just copy files over manually.

Contents of the `blocks` folder goes into `/user/share/i3blocks`

Contents of the `i3` folder goes into `/home/user/.i3/`

Contents of the `config` folder go into `/home/user/.config/`

## Requirements


[Ponymix](https://github.com/falconindy/ponymix), I compiled it.

[fonts-font-awesome](http://fontawesome.io/)

i3 and i3blocks
